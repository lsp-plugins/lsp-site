<p>
	This plugin introduces a multiband limiter with flexible configuration. In most cases it acts as a brick-wall limiter but
	there are several settings for which is acts as an compressor with extreme settings, so the output signal may exceed the limiter's threshold. 
	It prevents input <?= ($m) ? 'mono' : 'stereo' ?>signal
	from raising over the specified <b>Threshold</b>. <?php if ($sc) {?> Additional sidechain inputs are provided for better use.<?php } ?>
</p>
<p><u>Attention:</u> this plugin implements set of limiting modes, most of them are iterative. That means that CPU load may be not stable, in other
words: the more work should be done, the more CPU resources will be used. Beware from extreme settings.</p>
<p>The gain reduction algorithm consists of four stages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Per frequency band automated level regulation.</li>
    <li>Per frequency band brickwall gain reduction.</li>
    <li>Per mix automated level regulation.</li>
    <li>Per mix band brickwall gain reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>That means that plugin provides per frequency band limiting algorithm and post-limiting after all frequency bands become summed together.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    	<b>Automated Level Regulation</b> (<b>ALR</b>) acts like a compressor with infinite ratio 
    	for purpose of estimating the smoothed gain reduction level. The gain reduction level is controlled 
    	by the envelope of the signal applied to the compressor's gain reduction curve. The smoothness of the 
    	envelope is controlled by the <b>Attack</b> and <b>Release</b> knobs in the <b>ALR</b> section. Since 
    	different signals have different envelopes with short release time, the <b>Knee</b> knob allows to adjust 
    	the threshold of the compressor. Adjusting <b>Knee</b> may give possibility to gain some additional decibels
    	of loudness in the final result.
    </li>
    <li>
        Peak cutting algorithm which searches peaks above the threshold values and applies short gain reduction patches
        to the signal. The form of patch is controlled by the <b>Mode</b> selector and it's length is controlled by 
        the corresponding <b>Attack</b> and <b>Release</b> knobs. Note that <b>Lookahead</b> also affects these values:
        <b>Attack</b> can not be larger than <b>Lookahead</b> and <b>Release</b> can not be twice larger as <b>Lookahead</b>.
        Setting these values larger than allowed automatically makes them considered to be set to maximum possible values.
    </li>
</ul>
<li>Additional <b>Linear Phase</b> mode allows to split audio signal into multiple frequency bands with linear phase shift.
This introduces additional latency but gives several benefits:</li>
<ul>
	<li>Unlike classic crossovers which use IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filters to split signal into multiple bands and shift the phase
	of the audio signal at band split points, the <b>Linear Phase</b> allows to use FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters which are deprived of this.
	<li>Unlike most IIR filters which are designed using bilinear transform, linear phase filters allow to simulate their transfer function
	to look like the transfer function of analog filters, without deforming it's magnitude envelope near the nyquist frequency.</li>
	<li>Unlike design of classic Linkwitz-Riley filters, the design of IIR filters provides shorter transition zone of the filter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simplified peak processing example is shown on the following picture:</p>
<?php out_image('graph/limiter-reduction', 'Simplified peak processing example') ?>
<p>
	Of course, the output signal does not repeat the envelope form of input signal because it's amplitude is changed 
	smoothly, so in fact the form of output signal is more complicated.
</p> 
<p>
	Currently there are three forms of patches applied to the gain curve -
	<b>hermite</b> (using cubic polynom for interpolation transients), <b>exponential</b> and <b>linear</b>.
	These forms can be explained with following picture:
</p>
<?php out_image('graph/limiter-patches', 'Forms of patches applied to signal') ?>
<p>
	Gain reduction patch affects not only the peak sample, but also surrounding samples.
	The position and form of this interpolation is related to the peak, so there are four 
	different variants of patch envelope - <b>thin</b>, <b>tail</b>, <b>duck</b> and <b>wide</b>.
	All these forms related to the peak are shown on the following picture:
</p>
<?php out_image('graph/limiter-envelope', 'Envelope forms of the patch') ?>
<p>
	On this image, sloping lines mean the transition part of the patch.
	The flat cap in the middle before the peak is a half of attack time, the flat cap in the middle after the peak is a half of release time.
	Also it's obvious that different envelope forms differently affect dynamics of the signal.
